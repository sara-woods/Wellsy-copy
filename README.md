# Wellsy - Join a live workout from home🏋️‍♀️💪

Web app connecting freelance trainers with anyone who wants to join classes from the comfort of their own home.

## Motivation
Working out from home have become very common due to the pandemic. But it can be hard to find the motivation to workout alone and some might miss the feeling of working out in a class. Others might want a professional to lead them. It can also be tough for freelance trainers to reach customers. Working out via zoom with a trainer along others is a great alternative.

## Solution
A platform where users can create or book workout sessions and participate via zoom from their own home. 

We designed the platform for two types of users, trainers and trainees. Trainers can create activities and schedule sessions of them. Trainees can search for and filter sessions, pay for a selected session, and see a zoom link to join the session.

## Project outline
This was our second and last project during the final two weeks of the Le Wagon bootcamp, following our first project: [Floatify](https://github.com/sara-woods/floatify-copy).

The idea originally came from Sara Woods which she pitched during Le Wagon's pitch night. We then were grouped together based on our votes for the idea.

The entire website was built from scratch by us over a simple rails boilerplate, and we took the following process:

- Created user stories
- Outlined user actions
- Created a model schema
- Outlined necessary routes/controllers
- Created a Figma design
- Decided team workflow and began coding
- [Eric Payumo](https://github.com/Erickson1309) presented the MVP on the first Friday
- Improved the app based on feedback
- Added metatags, custom domain name and custom error pages
- [Sara Woods](https://github.com/sara-woods) presented the final project to a remote live event on Livestorm on the second Friday

Everyday we discussed our progress, decided what needed completing for the day, and then divided the tasks.
